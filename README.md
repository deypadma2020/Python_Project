ABSTRACT:

Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and a primary contributor to severe, long-term debilitation worldwide. This paper aims to compare various machine learning algorithms for stroke prediction using the Healthcare Dataset Stroke. Seven machine learning classification algorithms, namely Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor, Na√Øve Bayes, and KMeans Clustering, will be applied to construct a stroke prediction model. Cross-validation will also be employed with these algorithms to optimize results.

Work Planning:

- Day 1: I will review the STROKE PREDICTION data and conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

- Day 2: I will implement the Machine Learning Algorithms and draw overarching conclusions.

- Day 3 and Day 4: Documentation will be undertaken based on the earlier stroke prediction data analysis.

- Day 5: I will prepare a PowerPoint presentation on the stroke prediction data analysis.

I am commencing my project assignment today, July 15, 2022, and anticipate completion by July 19, 2022.
